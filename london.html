								<p>The London residential property market has always been strong. However, it is only in the last twenty years or so that property prices have increased to such levels that many areas of London have become unaffordable. While property hotspot have always existed, the process of gentrification have pushed up the prices even in periphera areas.</p>
								<p>The purpose of this exercise is to visualise the change that the London residential property market underwent during the period 1995-2013. I have carried out the analysis using publicly available information on residential property transactions. I provide further details on the data below.</p>

		<!-- Analysis -->
		
			<div class="wrapper style2">
			 	<article class="container" id="analysis">
			 			<div class="12u">
			 				<h1>Analysis</h1>
			 				<p>I have focused on two aspects of the London residential property market: <strong>average local prices</strong> and the <strong>frequency of transactions</strong> in each neighbourhood.</p>
			 				<p>The unit of analysis is the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wards_and_electoral_divisions_of_the_United_Kingdom">electoral ward</a></strong>. Wards are sufficiently small to be relatively homogenous in terms of the characteristics of the housing stock as well as demographics. This mean that taking averages does not hide too much information. </p>
			 			</div>	
			 			<div class="row">
			 				<div class="12u">
			 					<h2>Prices</h2>
			 				</div>
			 				<div class="4u">
			 					<h3>1995</h3>
			 					<p>The first graph shows a comparison of property prices at the beginning of the analysis period (Q1 1995): the chart shows some property hotspots. However, these are few and concentrated in the central boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, as well as Hampstead in the north. The average prices in the rest of the city appear to be uniform and (relatively) affordable.</p>

			 					<img src="images/2000-4-price.png" width="100%"></img>
			 				</div>
			 				<div class="4u">
			 					<h3>2000</h3>
			 					<p>By the end of the millennium, the situation has already changed significantly. While the central areas continue to be very expensive, new areas to the north (e.g. Camden) and to the South West (e.g Hammersmith, but also Richmond) have become significantly more expensive.</p>
			 					<p>The prices in the east of the city are still close to their 1995 level, though the prices in some areas such as Tower Hamlets, are beginning to increase. We can also observe a similar phenomenon at both the south-eastern and north-western outskirts.
			 				</div>
			 			</div>
			 			<div class="row">
			 				<div class="4u">
			 					<h3>Pre-financial crisis</h3>
			 					<p>Prices have kept on growing for most of the 2000s. At the eve of the financial crises, the growth areas identified above have become even more expensive. The map shows that there are now areas outside central London where the average property price is close to Â£1m.</p>
			 					<p>We can also observe an increase in average prices in the Docklands area (Tower Hamlets) which has undergone redevelopment and growth during this time</p>

							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<h3>2013</h3>
								<p>By the end of the analysis, we can see that the financial crises does not seem to have dented the growth in residential property prices. Growth in the core area has continued and has expanded to previously less expensive neighbouring areas.</p>
								<p>Price growth has also continued in the east (possible helped by the London Olympic Games in 2012) as well as in the South East and North West.</p>
								<p>The map shows that there are now only pockets of affordable areas.</p>

			 				</div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="4u">
								<h3>Before the crisis</h3>
								<p>The chart shows the total number of transactions in 2007 in each electoral ward.</p>
								<p>The London residential market is often very lively. For example, the chart here shows that in 2007 there were several transactions across the whole city.</p>

							<div class="8u">
								<img src="images/2009-freq.png" width="100%"></img>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<h3>The "credit crunch"</h3>
								<p>The financial crisis affected the entirety of the banking sector in the UK. Most banks had to be bailed out by the government. Those that were not rescued became strongly risk-averse. One of the consequences was the restriction on credit - known as the "credit crunch" - which made obtaining mortgages very hard. As a result, the number of property transactions dropped, as shown in the chart.</p>
								<p>Interestingly, the property prices were not affected significantly by the crisis. This supports the view that the price increases were driven by supply constraints. These are due to the fact that most of London is already built-up and the city is surrounded by a "green belt" where new developments are restricted.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="4u">
								<h3>Back to normal?</h3>
								<p>The chart shows that in 2013 the number of annual transactions has not yet gone back to the levels of 2007. The crisis was largely over by then, but for most buyers it was still relatively difficult to obtain a mortgage.</p>

								<h3>Market dynamics</h3>
								<p>The animation below shows the evolution of the number of transactions in each year of the period 1995-2013. The impact of the "credit crunch" in 2008 and 2009 is obvious</p>

								<h1>Methodology</h1>
				 			</div>
				 			<div class="12u">
				 				<h3>Data</h3>
				 				<p>I have used three main sources of data.</p>
				 				<ol>
				 					<li>The <strong>"price paid"</strong> dataset provided by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads">UK Land Registry.</a> The dataset contains a record for every single property sale. I have used data covering the period from January 1st 1995 to December 31st 2013.</li>
				 					<li>Detailed geographic "shapefile" data to draw the maps in R. The data are provided by the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html">UK Office for National Statistics</a> and can be downloaded from their <a href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/main/home.page">Open Geography portal.</a></li>
				 					<li><a href="http://ons.gov.uk/ons/taxonomy/index.html?nscl=Retail+Prices+Index">Quarterly inflation data (RPI)</a> from the Uk Office of National Statistics.</li>
				 				</ol>
				 				<h3>Approach</h3>
				 				<p>I have followed these steps. I have carried out most of the analysis in <strong>R</strong> and used <strong>Photoshop</strong> to generate the animated charts.</p>
				 				<ol>
				 					<li>First I have aggregated the data, which was provided in four separate files, into a single dataset. Then I trimmed the dataset by keeping only the most relevant columns, namely the date of the transaction, the price paid and the geographic information.</li>
				 					<li>Then I converted all prices, which were recorded in nominal terms, to a common price base (2013) using the UK inflation index. This makes the prices directly comparable.</li>
				 					<li>Using the dplyr package, I summarised the data by calculating average prices by ward and quarter, as well as the total number of transactions by ward for each year.</li>
					 				<li>I subset the geographic data, which is provided for the UK as a whole, to extract the information for Greater London. During this phase I have also corrected the data to fix any inconsistency with the price data and ensure a correct match of the information. Most of the corrections regarded the spelling of topographic names (a typical example is <em>St. George's</em> vs. <em>St George's</em>).</li>
					 				<li>Finally, I matched the price data with the geographic data, generating charts for each of the periods considered. The animations (GIFs) were created using Photoshop.</li>
					 			</ol>
				 				<h3>Downloads</h3>
				 				<ol>
					 				<li>The <a href="code.R">R code</a></li>
				 					<li>An example of <a href="example_data.csv">the property transactions data</a></li>
				 					<li>The <a href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/Docs/Boundaries/Wards_(GB)_2014_Boundaries_(Full_Extent).zip">geographic data</a>. The required files are those with extensions .dbf, .shp, .shx. (Note, this is a 57MB download).</li>

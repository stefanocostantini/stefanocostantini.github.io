                <h2>Notes from a beginner stallholder</h2>
                <h3>11th October 2025</h3>
                <p>A few days ago I had the opportunity to run a stall at the Open Art Market 
                    in Portobello Road. This is one of the regular art markets run by Open Art Spaces 
                    [insert link]. They provide a (lovely!) space for new and emerging artists to
                    showcase their work and reach new audiences, in very popular areas of London.
                </p>
                <p>I started my artistic journey not too long ago. To the extent that I was tempted 
                    to write "artistic" in quotes. Impostor syndrome, and all that…
                </p>
                <p>
                   I needn't have worried. I'm really pleased to say that the feedback I received 
                   on market day has been great. Lots of encouragement, and kind words for my work. 
                   Not every conversation turned into a sale, and I wasn't quite expecting that.
                </p>
                <p>
                   So, it was a great experience. I enjoyed being able to showcase my work 
                   to such a varied audience and get their direct feedback. 
                   I had great interactions, and I must admit that every sale was a real 
                   thrill (and I had a few sales). The whole atmosphere was very positive 
                   and energetic, and the day went by really quickly 
                   (which is always a good sign).
                </p>
                <p>
                   But, as it was my first time at an art market, the learning curve was definitely 
                   quite steep, both in the preparation phase and on the day. 
                   I think I got a few things right, while others I can definitely improve on. 
                </p>
                <p>
                   So I thought I'd share 9 lessons (or, rather, insights) I'll try to 
                   take on board for next time. These are based on my experience and 
                   geared toward artists that sell visual artwork, so your mileage might vary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, here goes...
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                      Presentation is key, especially for more expensive pieces. 
                      Getting a few (IKEA) frames for my original watercolour artwork added value 
                      to the pieces and helped people visualise how they would fit in their homes.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       Value and perception of value are two very different things. Just because 
                       you've spent a long time producing a particular original artwork, 
                       it doesn't necessarily make it more appealing than, say, a cheaper print. 
                       This is normal, and you shouldn't feel disappointed if this happens. 
                       Use it as a signal for your next market. 
                    </li>
                </ol>

								<p class="animate-box">
								I fly quite a bit between London and Barcelona. Independently of the airline I choose for a specific flights, these share quite a few characteristics.
								Specifically, they are all economy-class, hand-luggage, no-frills kind of
								flights. However, after trying all the major airlines that connect the two
								cities, I did perceive some differences between them.

								I was interested in finding out whether these differences in perception would be
								shared by the wider travelling public and whether they could be given some sort
								of structure.

								To do that, I downloaded a bunch of tweets during the month of December 2015
								that mentioned five of the major airlines connecting London and Barcelona. The
								dataset I used had about 29,000 tweets.

								I analysed these tweets by fitting a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. I had three objectives:
								<ol class="animate-box">
								<li>Identify some of the key topics that passengers discussed in their tweets,</li>
								<li>Determine the "sentiment" of each topic, i.e. determine whether it expressed a positive or a negative feeling.</li>
								<li>For each airline, identify the topics that its passengers discussed the most (and, based on the "sentiment" of each topic, observe whether its passengers had a positive or negative feeling towards it).</li>
								</ol>	
								</p>

								<h2><img src="images/plane.png" width="20px">&nbsp;</img>Topics</h2>
							</div>
														
							<div class="col-md-12 animate-box">
								<p class="animate-box">
								After cleaning the data a bit (remove stopwords, acronynims such as RT, and
								@-replies, etc.) I fit an LDA model with 50 topics to the corpus of tweets. Each
								topic is in fact a probability distribution over the dimensional space defined by all the words in the corpus. What differentiate one topic from another is the probability given to specific words.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">
								As they are probability distributions, topics do not come with "human-readable"
								labels. However, some of them lend themselves to some kind of interpretations. Out of the original 50 topics, I selected ten which seemed amenable to being given a label. Specifically, I identified:
								<ol class="animate-box">
								<li>One topic about "booking" flights (Topic 17)</li> 
								<li>One topic about "check-in"
								and boarding (Topic 42)</li>
								<li>Two topics about "customer service" (Topics 31 and 49)</li> 
								<li>Three topics about delay (Topics 11, 45 and 46)</li> 
								<li>Two topics about "luggage" (Topics 14 and 27)</li> 
								<li>One topic about "seating" (Topic 37)</li>
								</ol>
								</p>

								<p class="animate-box">
								Topics can be represented as word clouds, in which the size of each word is
								proportional to the probability given to that word in the distribution. If a word (or words) are given probabilities much higher than other words, we could simplify and say that that topic is "about those words". Below are the
								wordclouds for the ten topics I chose. You can click on each of them to enlarge
								it and explore it in detail.

							</div>
							<div class="col-md-12 animate-box">
								<p class="animate-box">
								Next, I tried to give a connotation (i.e. a positive or negative "sentiment") to
								each of the topics. Sentiment scoring of a document can be done by counting the
								number of occurences of words that belong to a "positive" or "negative" dictionary.
								</p>
								<p class="animate-box">
								To apply this approach to topics, I converted each into a vector repeating each word proportionally to their given probability within that topic. Thus, a topic giving a probabily of 20% to the word, say, "complaint" (which is word with negative connotation) would be converted into a vector where the word
								"complaint" would account for 20% of its elements.
								</p>
								<p class="animate-box">	
								The chart below shows the distribution of topics across the range of sentiment
								scores. Positive scores (to the right of the zero) denote a positive sentiment. We can observe that:
								<ul class="animate-box">
								<li>The mode of the distribution is to the right of zero and the distribution
								itself is skewed towards the right: this indicate that most topics have a
								positve connotation.</li>
								<li>Amongs the ten topics I have a chosen, there is only one topic which is really negative: topic 49. This is a topic associated to (bad) customer service. Note that there is also topic 39, which has a positive connotation, i.e. it refers to good customer service. However, it is not as extreme as the positive indicating that people are more restrained when it comes to praise good customer service. </li>
								<li>There is a bunch of topics which are "mildly" negative. These are associated to luggage, delay and checking-in. No surprises there.</li> 
								<li>Topic 17 (Booking) is the most positive topic. While it may be well the
								case that customer expressed their joy to having booked a flight, this is probably the topic of choice for the airlines' tweets advertising their flights and encouraging potential customers to book soon.</li>

							<div class="col-md-12 animate-box">
								<p class="animate-box">After scoring the topics, I allocated tweets to specific topics by considering, for each tweets, at the weights given to each topic: these weights measure the extent to which each tweet "belongs" to each specific topic.</p>

								<p class="animate-box">The five charts below show, for each airline, the popularity of each topic in
								terms of the allocation of its tweets to them. We can see some differences
								between the airlines. (Click on each chart to enlarge.) Note that the scores are normalised by the total number of tweets for each airline, to facilitate
								comparisons. Some airlines attract more tweets than others.</p>

								<p class="animate-box">
								First, let's consider topic 49. Recall that this is about bad customer service.
								The first two airlines score pretty high here. These are a national carrier and
								an orange no frills airline. Interestingly, the airline with the lower score here is a another famous no frills airline, this time blue.</p>

								<p class="animate-box">
								Let's now look at the most positive topic: Topic 17 (Booking). The same no
								frills airline scores pretty high here. This reinforces my suspicion that these
								tweets are probably promotional tweets by the airline itself.</p>

								<p class="animate-box">
								The blue and purple topics are generally negative. They are generally popular
								across all airlines. They are less so for the fifth airline, which is a Spanish
								no frills carrier. While this may be due to the fact that this airline offers a
								good service, most likely this result is due to the fact that many of the tweets
								mentioning this airline are in Spanish, while I have only considered English
								tweets. I might have missed out a lot of praise or a lot of complaints.</p>

								<p class="animate-box">Finally, Topic 37 is about seating. It's a "positive" topic (albeit only just). Airline 4 (the blue no frills one) scores poorly here. This is not a surprise.</p>

								<h2><img src="images/plane.png" width="20px">&nbsp;</img>Topic ownership</h2>
							</div>
							
							<div class="col-md-12 animate-box">
								<p class="animate-box">To conclude, I've looked at the allocation of topics to the 5 airlines I considered. The chart below shows the "topic ownership" for each topic. In this case, the counts are normalised be the total number of tweets allocated to each topic.</p>
							</div>
							
							<div class="col-md-12 animate-box" id="ownership">
								<img src="images/ownership.png"></img>
							</div>
							
							<div class="col-md-12 animate-box">
								<p class="animate-box"><p>
								As seen above, Topic 17 (the most positive of all) is "owned" by airline 4
								(those promotional tweets!). And so is topic 42, about checking in.
								</p>
								<p class="animate-box">We can also see that topic 49, the most negative one (bad customer service) is
								almost shared equally amongst all airlines. It would seem, that airlines still have some work to do to differentiate themselves. I am sure that each of these negative tweets was caused by circumstances outside the airlines' control.
